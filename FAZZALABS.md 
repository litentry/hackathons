Here is our problems and solutions and short Project introduction :
In community development, scores as identity metrics, rooted in Labor Theory principles, offer a transformative approach to assess and foster collective growth.

This method delves into the intrinsic labor value of each contribution, encompassing time, effort, skill, and creativity. By emphasizing the labor cost in each action, from visible achievements to behind-the-scenes efforts, we develop scoring metrics that reflect the true essence of individual contributions. This approach ensures that all forms of labor, regardless of visibility, are appropriately valued, fostering a community culture of recognition, fairness, and motivated engagement. It aligns scoring with the labor cost theory, promoting an environment where every member's contributions are acknowledged, enhancing both individual and collective development.

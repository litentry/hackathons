Join the Litentry Team for the **TrustCraft: Identity Hackathon** events as part of DevConnect in Istanbul, Turkey on November 17, 2023. 


## Themes

Participants can select from the following themes for their hacking projects:

### VC Use Cases (Tech Track)
  Develop products that leverage decentralized identity and deliver value to users by harnessing Litentry's verifiable credentials across multiple blockchain networks. 
    
  Requirements: 
  * Product must be developed upon the blockchain of the selected ecosystem(s). 
  * You can use existing VCs from IdentityHub or create new ones. When generating new VCs, ensure that the assertions contained within them can be retrieved directly from the blockchain. Documenting the VC construction process is not necessary. While VCs are issued in JSON format, you can integrate it with NFTs or  SBTs to bridge to a broader world. Stay tuned for the upcoming VC SDK and documentation!
  * A prototype dApp would be great, but well-demonstrated ideas and concepts are welcome as well.

### Scores & Profiles Design (Non-tech Track)
  Scores are useful identity metrics that offer communities and groups a lens through which to assess, evolve, and thrive. These metrics highlight the aspects that captivate and resonate within a community, providing individuals with a path for personal growth and alignment.
  
  Requirements: 
  * Design Scores or build profiles comprising multiple score elements that showcase the credibility, contributions, and diverse merits of members from a specific community or group.
  * Clearly outline the methodology for calculating each score, describe the meaning and impact of the scores or profiles, and their relevance to the specific community or groups they target.
  * Specify the data prerequisites for each score or profile. You can either provide the required data yourself or collaborate with the Litentry team to access the necessary data sources.
